How to Swap Tokens Using Pontem Network on Aptos
Swapping tokens using Pontem Network on Aptos is easy and straightforward. To initiate a swap, send a POST request with your private_key, the from_token, to_token, and the amount to be swapped. Here’s an example:
Example Request to Swap Tokens:
{
  "private_key": "your_private_key",
  "from_token": "APT",
  "to_token": "USDT",
  "amount": 1000,
  "slippage": 0.5
}
Example Python Code for Swapping Tokens:
import requests

# Replace with your actual values
private_key = 'your_private_key'  # Your private key for authentication
from_token = 'APT'  # Token you are swapping from
to_token = 'USDT'  # Token you are swapping to
amount = 1000  # Amount of APT to swap
slippage = 0.5  # Tolerance for slippage (0.5% by default)

def swap_tokens():
    url = 'https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/swap'
    payload = {
        "private_key": private_key,
        "from_token": from_token,
        "to_token": to_token,
        "amount": amount,
        "slippage": slippage
    }
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print('Swap Response:', response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        if response := e.response:
            print('Error:', response.json())
        else:
            print('Error:', e)

# Run the function
swap_tokens()
Example Successful Response:
{
  "status": "success",
  "tx_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
}
Example Error Response:
{
  "status": "failed",
  "message": "Insufficient funds",
  "error": "Your Aptos balance is too low to complete this transaction."
}
How to Add Liquidity to Pontem Network

Example Request to Add Liquidity:
{
  "private_key": "your_private_key",
  "token_a": "APT",
  "token_b": "USDT",
  "amount_a": 500,
  "amount_b": 500
}
How to Monitor Liquidity on Aptos
You can check the liquidity of token pairs on Pontem Network to see the total liquidity available for swaps. Use the liquidity endpoint to fetch this data.
Example Python Code to Fetch Liquidity Data:

def get_liquidity_data():
    url = 'https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/liquidity'
    
    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print('Liquidity Data:', response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print('Error fetching liquidity:', e)

get_liquidity_data()
Example Liquidity Response:
{
  "APT-USDT": {
    "total_supply": "1000000",
    "liquidity": "750000",
    "price": "1.00"
  },
  "APT-BTC": {
    "total_supply": "500000",
