# Swap Tokens Using Pontem Network on Aptos
The Pontem Network on Aptos enhances the ecosystem by providing cross-chain token swaps, bridging assets across different networks while ensuring low-cost, lightning-fast transactions.

# Aptos Network: Seamless Token Swaps with Pontem Network Integration

## Introduction

The **Aptos Network** is a next-generation blockchain designed for scalability, speed, and security. By addressing the challenges of traditional blockchains, Aptos provides a robust solution for decentralized applications (dApps) and financial services.

**Pontem Network** extends the capabilities of Aptos by enabling **cross-chain token swaps** and liquidity provisioning. With Pontem, users can exchange assets across different blockchain networks (such as Aptos and Ethereum) with low fees and fast transactions.

## Key Features of Aptos and Pontem Network

### 1. High-Speed Transactions
Aptos can handle thousands of transactions per second (TPS), making it ideal for decentralized applications and services that require real-time processing.

### 2. Low Transaction Fees
Aptos offers some of the lowest transaction fees in the blockchain space, which makes token swaps and other operations more cost-effective for users.

### 3. Cross-Chain Swaps with Pontem Network
Pontem Network enables efficient cross-chain swaps, allowing users to seamlessly exchange tokens between different blockchain networks (Aptos, Ethereum, and others) with minimal cost.

### 4. No Limits or Restrictions
Unlike many blockchain networks, Aptos and Pontem Network have no rate limits or transaction caps, giving users the freedom to execute an unlimited number of swaps or operations.

### 5. No Registration Required
Aptos offers a registration-free experience. You donâ€™t need to create an account or sign up on any centralized platform. Simply use your private key to interact with the network.

## Getting Started with the Pontem Network API on Aptos

The **Pontem Network API** allows you to perform token swaps, liquidity management, and other decentralized finance (DeFi) operations directly on the Aptos blockchain.

### API Endpoints:
- **Swap Tokens**: `POST https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/swap`
- **Add Liquidity**: `POST https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/addLiquidity`
- **Check Liquidity**: `GET https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/liquidity`

## How to Swap Tokens Using Pontem Network on Aptos

To swap tokens, send a POST request with the required parameters: `private_key`, `from_token`, `to_token`, `amount`, and `slippage`.

### Example Request:
```json
{
  "private_key": "your_private_key",
  "from_token": "APT",
  "to_token": "USDT",
  "amount": 1000,
  "slippage": 0.5
}

### Example Python Code to Swap Tokens:
import requests

# Replace with your actual values
```python
private_key = 'your_private_key'  # Your private key for authentication
from_token = 'APT'  # Token you are swapping from
to_token = 'USDT'  # Token you are swapping to
amount = 1000  # Amount of APT to swap
slippage = 0.5  # Tolerance for slippage (0.5% by default)

def swap_tokens():
    url = 'https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/swap'
    payload = {
        "private_key": private_key,
        "from_token": from_token,
        "to_token": to_token,
        "amount": amount,
        "slippage": slippage
    }

    try:
        response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print('Swap Response:', response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print('Error:', e)

### Run the function
swap_tokens()

Example Response:
Success:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "tx_hash": "0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
}

Error:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "message": "Insufficient funds",
  "error": "Your Aptos balance is too low to complete this transaction."
}

### How to Add Liquidity to Pontem Network
Liquidity providers can add liquidity to different token pairs using the Pontem Network API. To do so, specify the tokens and amounts you wish to add to the liquidity pool.

## Example Request to Add Liquidity:
```json
{
  "private_key": "your_private_key",
  "token_a": "APT",
  "token_b": "USDT",
  "amount_a": 500,
  "amount_b": 500
}

### How to Monitor Liquidity on Aptos

You can use the liquidity endpoint to check the available liquidity for token pairs across the network.
## Example Python Code to Fetch Liquidity Data:
```python
import requests

def get_liquidity_data():
    url = 'https://aptos-network.pro/api/pontemnetwork/liquidity'

    try:
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print('Liquidity Data:', response.json())
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print('Error fetching liquidity:', e)

get_liquidity_data()

## Example Liquidity Response:
```json

{
  "APT-USDT": {
    "total_supply": "1000000",
    "liquidity": "750000",
    "price": "1.00"
  },
  "APT-BTC": {
    "total_supply": "500000",
    "liquidity": "400000",
    "price": "0.5"
  }
}
